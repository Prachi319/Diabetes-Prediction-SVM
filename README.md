# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to **predict whether a person has diabetes** based on medical measurements and patient data. We use a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier for accurate and efficient predictions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Diabetes is a growing global health concern. Early detection through predictive models can help in timely diagnosis and preventive care. The goal is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using health-related attributes.

  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age

- Target:
  - `1` → Diabetic  
  - `0` → Non-diabetic

## 🔧 Algorithm Used

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal decision boundary (hyperplane) between two classes.

## 🧠 Workflow

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning  
2. Handling Missing/Zeros  
3. Train-Test Split  
4. Feature Scaling  
5. SVM Model Training  
6. Evaluation with Accuracy score

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ✅ Results

- The model successfully classifies patients based on medical records.
- Can be used as a base for healthcare risk prediction systems.



## 🚀 Future Scope

- Apply grid search and hyperparameter tuning.
- Try other models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
- Create a web interface for prediction (e.g., using Streamlit).
